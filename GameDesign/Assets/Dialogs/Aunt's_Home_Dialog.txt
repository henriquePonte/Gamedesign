***Chair;Just a regular chair;What else is there to say?;I mean, it looks kinda comfy;And the craftmanship is nothing to scof at;But then again so are all the chairs;Wait, they are all from the same company, probably mass factured if then;I guess that does lower the artistic integrity of them;But then again, someone had to design them, so does that give it some soul;...;Oh wow, I guess there was more to say
